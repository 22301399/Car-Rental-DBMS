## Project Description
This project is a **Rental Car System** designed to manage the core operations of a car rental business.  
The system stores and organizes information about cars, customers, rentals, payments, and employees.

The main goal of the project is to design and implement a relational database that:
- Maintains data consistency and integrity
- Allows efficient data insertion, updating, and deletion
- Supports complex SQL queries for management and reporting purposes

## Database Design
The database consists of **at least six related tables** connected using primary and foreign keys.  
An **Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD)** is provided to visually represent the structure and relationships between entities.

The design includes:
- Proper use of primary keys and foreign keys
- Constraints such as `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, and default values
- Normalized tables to reduce data redundancy

## Data Implementation
The database is populated using **DML statements** to insert, update, and delete records.  
Sample data is added to demonstrate realistic rental operations.

## SQL Queries
The project includes **15+ SQL queries** that:
- Use `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`
- Apply aggregate functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG`
- Use string, numeric, and date functions
- Provide useful insights for management decision-making

Screenshots of query results are included in the documentation.

## Technology Used
- **Database Platform:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **ER Diagram Tool:** Visual Paradigm
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## Repository Structure
All project materials are organized into folders containing:
- ERD diagrams
- DDL and DML SQL files
- Query scripts
- Screenshots of query results
- Final project report
